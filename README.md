# sifive_hifive1_revb_pwm_bare_metal
This an example of how I used PWM to change the brightness of the RGB led on the hifive1 revb board.

The repository contains a freedomstudio project foler.
The usefull files are in src directory. If the project doesn't work  you can create a new project and copy the main.c, PWM.c and PWM.h files over.

You can copy this code and do whatever you want with it.
I will probably not update this repository.

I don't know if there are licenses in subdirectories of the project, those license should of course be respected. 
The code in src/main.c src/PWM.c and src/PWM.h may be used unlicensed.
